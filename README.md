Terraform - Write a terraform code which will create a S3 Bucket, create a Cloudfront distribution and upload a simple "index.html" to the bucket. Output to the terraform code should be the cloudfront distribution URL and on hitting the URL, "index.html" should be served.

At first my script will create a s3 bucket .
Then it will upload a index.html file to s3.
Then it will create our cloudfront distribution which will host our index.html.
